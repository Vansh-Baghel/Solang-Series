# Lesson 1: Getting Started

Whether you have experience with Ethereum, blockchains, or websites, or are new to the world of development, this guide is designed to be helpful and informative and help you learn about developing on the Solana blockchain.3

This comprehensive guide is designed to provide you with a step-by-step approach to learning and mastering Solana development. With clear and concise instructions, you'll have all the information you need to become a successful Solana developer.

# Objectives

This lesson will help you understand more about the course, its benefits to the end user, what will be taught to the user, the course structure, and the prerequisites required for the course.

# What is Web3?

Web3 essentially represents the next evolution of the internet. It is the decentralized and user-centric web, where individuals have greater control over their data and digital interactions. 

Web3 leverages blockchain technology, smart contracts, and decentralized applications (DApps) to enable peer-to-peer transactions, digital identity ownership, and trustless collaboration. It empowers users to interact with online platforms in a more secure, private, and autonomous manner, fundamentally changing how we engage with the digital world.

# How will this course help you?

In this course, you will learn how to develop programs on Solana using Solidity, including how to deploy and interact with smart contracts on the Solana network. You will also gain practical experience in developing decentralized applications on Solana using Solidity, and explore the various tools and frameworks available for Solana development.

By the end of this course, you will have a deep understanding of Solana programming using Solidity, and be equipped with the skills and knowledge needed to build decentralized applications and smart contracts on Solana.

# What will I learn in this course?

In this course, you will:

- Develop decentralised applications on the Solana blockchain.
- Learn how to build and deploy smart contracts.
- Create production-grade full-stack web3 applications.
- Learn to integrate tools for your apps in your dApp.

# What is the course structure?

The course contains 8 modules each with lessons for a particular topic. 

Each lesson starts with a clear outline of its objectives, providing a preview of what you will be learning in that lesson.

There is a brief tl;dr for every lesson which briefly goes through the content of the course.

Each lesson is divided into 3 parts:

- **Overview -** A concise overview of the lesson, aimed at providing an initial understanding of the topic covered. It aims to provide an introduction to the lesson's content.
- ****Demo -**** It is a tutorial-esque project related to the content of the particular lesson.

The course and its contents are divided in such a way that it helps you grasp the contents of the course easily. 

# Prerequisites

Before diving in, it's helpful to already have some coding experience in any programming language, especially JavaScript/TypeScript.

To set up the development environment, you need the following dependencies installed in your local device:

- Windows Terminal
- Node.js (version 18.0 or above)
- Git (version 2.0 or above)
- VSCode

A basic understanding of Solidity (used in Ethereum) and the Solana ecosystem will also come in handy.
