# Lesson 2: **Setting Up Development Environment**

# Install Dependencies (Prerequisites)

We are Installing and setting up required dependencies for working with Solidity on the Solana blockchain development platform Make sure to do this on your preferred system, whether it's Linux, MacOS, or Windows.

## **Install and set up Rust**

Rust is mandatory to be installed because Anchor and Solang use Rust to build programs. To install Rust, follow the steps in the following link:

https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install

Make sure the installation is successful by running the following commands in the terminal:

```
rustup --version
rustc --version
cargo --version

```

## **Install and set up Node.js**

Anchor requires Node.js on your machine to run so if you don’t have it, install it from here:

https://nodejs.org/en

Once the installation is completed confirm successful installation by running the following commands:

```
node --version
npm --version

```

## **Installing Yarn**

Anchor also requires yarn on your machine to run. If you don’t have it yet install it by running the following command in the terminal:

```
npm i -g yarn

```

## **Now Install and set up the Solana Tools Suite**

Next, we need to install Solana-tools from here. As mentioned solang pre-bundled with Solana tool suite.

The main things we'll be doing with the Solana CLI will be configuring our network (to devnet) as well as airdropping tokens into our wallets. Everything else we'll be doing with the Anchor CLI. Download Solana tools by navigating to the link below.

https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools

After a successful installation run:

```
solana --version

```

Make a wallet account that you'll use later for deploying the program on Solana Devnet.

```
solana-keygen new

```

## **Install and Configure Solang**

The newest Solang version comes already included with the Solana Tools Suite that you've set up before. It should now work well together with Solana CLI.

To make sure Solang is installed correctly, run this command.

```
Solang --version

```

If everything is fine you see something like this

```
➜  ~ solang --version
solang version v0.3.1
➜  ~

```

## **Install and Configure Anchor Framework**

Navigate to the following link and install the Anchor Framework.

https://www.anchor-lang.com/docs/installation

Once you've set up everything, just use the following command to install Confirm AVM and Anchor CLI:

```
avm --version
anchor --version

```

If everything is fine you see something like this

```
➜  ~ avm --version
avm 0.28.0
➜  ~ anchor --version
anchor-cli 0.28.0
➜  ~

```

## **Install and Configure Solang VSCode Extension**

For this, open up VSCode and click on the Extensions tab on the left side of the window. In the Search bar, look up Solang Solidity Compiler click on top result (as shown below) and install the extension.

With the setup complete, you can move on to initialising your next project using the Anchor project.

# Installing and Setting up Solana Wallet

To install and set up a Solana wallet for deployment and testing purposes, follow these steps:

1. Download a trusted Solana wallet app like Phantom.
2. Create a new wallet within the app.
3. Securely store your wallet's seed phrase, as it's crucial for account recovery.
4. You can now use your Solana wallet to manage, store, and transact with Solana-based cryptocurrencies and NFTs on the Solana blockchain.
