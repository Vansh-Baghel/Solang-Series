# Objectives

In this module, you will:

- Learn how to build an spl-token-minter program using Solidity within the Anchor framework.
- Develop a working on-chain program for the Solana blockchain.
- Gain hands-on experience in creating and minting fungible tokens on Solana.

## tl;dr

In this tutorial, you'll explore Solana and Solang to create an ********spl-token-minter******** program using Solidity. By the end, you'll have a functional on-chain program for Solana, allowing low-cost and fast interactions with the blockchain. This practical example is part of the Solang series and provides a hands-on guide for creating and minting fungible tokens on Solana using Solidity.

# Overview

In this module, we take a deep dive into Solana and Solang to show you how to build an spl-token-minter program using Solidity.
By the end of this module, you will have developed a working on-chain program that can be deployed to the Solana blockchain and cam interact with the Solana blockchain for extremely low fees and fast confirmation times.
This is the second part of the Solang series, featuring a practical example using a Solidity program called **spl-token-minter** within the Anchor framework. This example will give you hands-on experience in creating and minting fungible tokens on Solana using Solidity.
The code for the project is locatedÂ [here](https://github.com/shivamsoni00/mintgoldtoken/tree/master).
In the next lesson, we will set up the development workspace.
