modulePartDescription: In this part of the module, you will receive a brief introduction to minting tokens and the setup for local development. You will establish a new project directory and utilize the Anchor framework to create an SPL token minter program.

## Objectives:

In this lession, you will:

- Create a development workspace for your minter project.
- Understand the boilerplate code that comes along with installing the Anchor framework.
- Recognise the difference between a Solana program and an Ethereum smart contract.

## tl;dr

In this lession, we set up the development workspace for our token minter project, which involves setting up the project directory. The boilerplate code of the framework is also explained in this lession. Finally, we wrap up by examining the difference between the Solidity code of a Solana program and an Ethereum smart contract.

# Overview

Start off by creating a new folder. This is where all your work will be located. Once you have created the folder, open a terminal in that folder and run the following command.

```bash
anchor init spl-token-minter --solidity
```

This will take some time. Anchor will be installing all dependencies that are needed for the project.

After that, navigate to the project directory by running the following command in the terminal:

```bash
cd spl-token-minter
```

Run the following command to open VSCode:

```bash
code .
```

Once VSCode has started, you will see that the project will have a structure as shown:

![project File overviews](/moduleimages/a_generated.png)

By default, this is Anchor organizes newly created project. In building our project, we will focus on these folders/files only. Here's a simplified and concise version of the content:

- **app**: This folder holds frontend code if you plan to build and host it together with your code.
- **solidity**: This folder contains your actual Solana smart contract code in ".sol" files.
- **tests**: Here, you can test how your contract behaves when used, helping you build, deploy, and test Solana programs.
- **anchor.toml**: Similar to package.json for Node.js, this tracks dependencies and important Anchor settings. You can install the toml VSCode extension to work with it easily.
- .**gitignore**: This file lists the things to ignore when you share your code on GitHub.

You can ignore these for now: migrations, node_modules, .prettierignore, package.json, tsconfig.json. We'll go over them later.


> *Note -:* If you're used to working with Solidity on Ethereum, you know about Mainnet and Testnet. With Solana, it might be a bit surprising to find out that there are three options instead of two.

Types of Solana Blockchain Cluster:

1. **Mainnet**: This is the actual Solana Blockchain where you use real SOL cryptocurrency. It's for doing real things with Solana programs, and once they're here, they can't be undone.
2. **Devnet:** When you're building on Solana using Solidity, you'll mostly be working here. It's a place to test your Solana programs before they go live on Mainnet. On Devnet, you get free SOL through airdrops (I'll explain how to get it below). Unlike Mainnet, stuff on Devnet can be reset, which means what you put here might not stay forever.
3. **Testnet**: This is like Devnet, The Testnet is where Solana's main team carefully tests the newest release features in a live cluster setup. Their main goal is to check network performance, stability, and validator behaviour while also paying attention to good grammar, clear writing, and a smooth flow of information.

You'll only need to worry about Testnet if you're directly dealing with the Solana protocol. The tokens on Testnet aren't real money, and you can get free SOL through airdrops.

In ***anchor.toml*** file you will need to change cluster: localnet to devnet

Once changed, the Anchor.toml should look like below:

### Checkpoint

> Next Change wallet in ***.toml File*** to your newly generated keypair address in your local system

Next, let’s go over the starter code beginning with the on-chain program itself. Within your project's `./solidity` directory, you’ll find the following contract named spl-token-minter.sol below, which includes:

- A constructor for state variable initialization.
- A flip function to update the state variable.
- A print function for messages in the program logs.
- A get function to retrieve the current state variable value.

## Important Differences 

***Compared with EVM smart contract***

Compared to an EVM smart contract, there are two important differences you might notice:

The `@program_id` annotation:

On Solana, smart contracts are referred to as ***programs***. The **@program_id** annotation is used to specify the on-chain address of the program.

```solidity
@program_id("F1ipperKF9EfD821ZbbYjS319LXYiBmjhzkkf5a26rC")
```

on-chain program address.

The **@payer** annotation:

**When storing data on the Solana blockchain, a certain amount of SOL needs to be allocated to cover the storage costs and the rent**(we will discuss this later in further articles). The @payer annotation specifies the user that will pay the SOL required to create the account for storing the state variable.

```solidity
@payer(payer) // payer for the "data account"
constructor(address payer) {
    print("Hello, World!");
}
```

**Storing of state data**

An important distinction between EVM smart contracts and Solana programs is how each store ***state*** variables/data:

EVM smart contracts can directly store state variables.

Solana on-chain programs, on the other hand, create separate accounts to hold state data. These are often referred to as **data accounts** and are **owned** by a program.

In this example, when the contract is deployed, it is deployed to the address specified in @program_id. When the constructor is called after the program is deployed, a separate account with its address is created to store the state variable, instead of being stored within the contract itself.

In the next lession, we explore creating our Solidity program.
