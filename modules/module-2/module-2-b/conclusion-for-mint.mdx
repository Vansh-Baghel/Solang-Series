# Overview

This module delved deep into different aspects of Solana program development using Solidity. It laid a solid foundation by highlighting the differences in behaviour between Solidity programs on the Solana and Ethereum platforms.
To enhance clarity and organization, the article was methodically partitioned into distinct sections, facilitating a well-structured grasp of the subject matter for readers.

The initial section was dedicated to imparting a fundamental comprehension of Solidity Solana programs within the context of the Solana ecosystem. This segment intricately explained multiple aspects of Solana blockchain development utilizing the Solidity (Solang) approach.
The subsequent sections offered an engaging hands-on experience by meticulously detailing the creation of a "spl-token-minter" program using Solidity. This practical example empowered readers with the ability to practically apply the previously discussed concepts.
As the series advances, the upcoming module will pivot its focus towards crafting a Flip program using **CPI (Cross-Program-Invocation)** and **PDA (Program Derived Address)** in Solidity (Solang), thereby deepening and expanding the scope of knowledge conveyed throughout this series.
