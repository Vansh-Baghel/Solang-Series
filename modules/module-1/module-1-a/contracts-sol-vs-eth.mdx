# Objective

In this lession, you will:

- Get a brief Overview Of Developing a Solana program in Solidity using the Anchor framework.

## tl;dr

In this lession, we provide a case study showcasing Solana programs and how they are different to Ethereum smart contracts, in development, tools and technologies.

# Overview

Within the realm of Solana, the [Anchor](https://www.anchor-lang.com/) framework serves as the tool of choice for crafting Solana programs. A multitude of programming languages are at one's disposal for building on the Solana platform, including Rust(via native and anchor), C, C++, Python([seahorse](https://seahorse-lang.org/)), and most recently, **_Solidity via the Solang compiler_**. This means you can develop your Solana programs using the Solidity language through the pre-integrated Solang compiler within the Solana tools, akin to how [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) and [Remix IDE](https://remix-project.org/) ease Ethereum's development environment. as Ethereum features Solidity smart contracts, Solana boasts its equal: Solana programs.
