# Exploring Solang

# Objectives

In this lesson, you will be:

- Introduced to the Solang compiler
- Understand Solana program compilation in detail.

## tl:dr

This lesson explores Solang. It is the Solidity Compiler for creating Solana smart contracts using the Solidity programming language. It utilizes the llvm framework to generate efficient WebAssembly (WASM) or Solana SBF contract code, reducing execution costs. It's compatible with Ethereum's Solidity compiler (v0.8) and seamlessly integrates with Solana development tools like Anchor for easy Solana program development and deployment.

## Overview

[Solang](https://solang.readthedocs.io/) is a Solidity Compiler designed to enable the creation of Solana programs—referred to as 'smart contracts' in other blockchain contexts—using the Solidity programming language.

The compiler leverages the [llvm](https://www.llvm.org/) compiler framework to generate WebAssembly (WASM) or Solana SBF contract code. This approach yields optimized output, resulting in reduced gas costs or compute units during execution.

Solang is crafted to maintain source file compatibility with version 0.8 of the Ethereum EVM Solidity compiler.

Moreover, it integrates with established Solana development tools and frameworks, such as Anchor, facilitating the streamlined construction and deployment of Solana programs rooted in the Solidity language.

In the next lesson, we take a look at the differences between solidity for Solana and solidity for Ethereum.
