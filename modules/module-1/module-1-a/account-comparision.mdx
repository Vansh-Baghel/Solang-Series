# Solidity Basics

# Objectives

In this lesson, you will:

- Become familiar with Solidity
- Understand the unique features of Solidity
- Understand practical applications of programs developed using Solidity.

## tl;dr

This lesson provides a brief introduction to Solidity. It is a programming language developed for Ethereum in 2015. It is high-level, object-oriented, and draws inspiration from Python, C++, and JavaScript. Solidity is the foundation for Ethereum smart contracts and can create various contracts like voting systems, auctions, crowdfunding, and more.

## Overview

Solidity is a recently developed programming language originating from Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency market by capitalization. Introduced in 2015 under the guidance of Christian Reitwiessner, Ethereum's core developer, Solidity possesses a set of significant attributes:

- Solidity serves as a high-level programming language crafted for implementing smart contracts.
- It adheres to a typed object-oriented (contract-oriented) paradigm.
- The design of Solidity draws significant inspiration from programming languages like Python, C++, and JavaScript, all which function on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).
- Solidity boasts support for intricate user-defined programming constructs, libraries, and inheritance.
- As the predominant language, Solidity is the foundation for blockchain platforms.
- The capabilities of Solidity extend to creating diverse contracts such as voting systems, blind auctions, crowdfunding mechanisms, multi-signature wallets, and more.
