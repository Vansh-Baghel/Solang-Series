# Objective

In this lesson, you will:

- Develop a Solana program in Solidity using the Anchor framework.
- Highlight the equivalent role of Solana programs in the Solana ecosystem, akin to Ethereum's Solidity smart contracts.
- Present the range of programming languages available for developing on the Solana platform

## tl;dr

In this lesson, we provide a case study showcasing Solana programs and how they are different to Ethereum smart contracts, and we also develop a project using the Anchor framework. The Anchor framework allows you to develop Solana programs using Solidity, similar to Ethereum's development environment.

# Overview

Within the realm of Solana, the Anchor framework serves as the tool of choice for crafting Solana programs. A multitude of programming languages are at one's disposal for building on the Solana platform, including Rust(via native and anchor), C, C++, Python(seahorse), and most recently, Solidity via the Solang compiler. This means you can develop your Solana programs using the Solidity language through the pre-integrated Solang compiler within the Solana tools, akin to how Hardhat and Remix IDE ease Ethereum's development environment. as Ethereum features Solidity smart contracts, Solana boasts its equal: Solana programs.
