# **Objectives**

In this lesson, you will:

- Become familiar with Solidity for Solana
- Understand the unique features of Solidity
- Understand practical applications of programs developed using Solidity.

# **tl;dr**

This lesson provides a brief introduction to Solidity. It is a programming language developed for Ethereum in 2015. It is high-level, object-oriented, and draws inspiration from Python, C++, and JavaScript. Solidity is the foundation for Ethereum smart contracts and can create various contracts like voting systems, auctions, crowdfunding, and more.

# **Overview**

Solidity is a recently developed programming language originating from Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency market by capitalization. Introduced in 2015 under the guidance of Christian Reitwiessner, Ethereum's core developer, Solidity possesses a set of significant attributes:

- Solidity serves as a programming language crafted for implementing smart contracts, forming the foundation for most blockchain platforms
- The design of Solidity draws significant inspiration from programming languages like Python, C++, and JavaScript, all of which function on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).
- Solidity boasts support for intricate user-defined programming constructs, libraries, and much more.
- The capabilities of Solidity extend to creating diverse contracts such as voting systems, blind auctions, crowdfunding mechanisms, multi-signature wallets, and more.

***The brief overview of solidity concepts that we will use in the next examples.***

The Solidity language supported by Solang aims to be compatible with the latestÂ [Ethereum Foundation Solidity Compiler](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/), version 0.8 with some small exceptions.

Differences:

- Solang generates WebAssembly or Solana SBF rather than EVM.
- Packed encoding uses little-endiann encoding, as WASM and SBF are little-endiann virtual machines.

Important components of Solang:

1. File and contract structure
2. Imports
3. Pragmas
4. Data types (like address and some primitives)
5. Constructor
6. Functions

In the next lesson, we go through the File and Contract Strucures of a typical solang-compiled Solidity program.
