modulePartDescription: In this part of the module, you will delve into code design and develop an actual flip program by utilizing cross-program invocation techniques in Solana using Solidity. The process begins with creating an interface in Solidity. Subsequently, you will write tests for it using `TypeScript` and proceed with building, deploying, and testing this flip program.

# Conclusion

In this lesson, we've taken a detailed look at the concept of composability in Web3 programs, with a special focus on Solana using Solang (a solidity-compatible compiler).

In the theoretical part, we've covered cross-program invocation and how to create it using the invoke method by setting up the necessary instructions for the invocation. We've also delved into the inner workings of cross-program invocations in Solang, including the autogenerated invoke function by the Solang compiler.

In the practical section, we've walked through a hands-on example where we built a flip functionality to toggle power on and off, showcasing how cross-program invocation can be applied.

***In our upcoming modules, we will further explore the concept by delving into invoke_signed, which requires PDA authority for cross-program invocations***.
