# Objective

In this lesson, we briefly go through the content of the course, where we will be transferring Solana tokens using Solidity.

## tl;dr

In our earlier module, we've discussed different aspects of Solana programs. We explained how Solana programs work, talked about using Invoke CPI to make switch power programs, and explored the idea of composability in Solana programs. In this module, we will take a deeper look at transferring our gold token to another associated token account by utilizing the Invoke CPI method.

# Overview

In the previous modules, we laid the foundation by understanding how Solana's high-performance blockchain merges with the familiar Solidity syntax. we learned how to build smart contracts and make cross program invocation easily.

In this module,  we will explore the intriguing concept of Cross Program Invocation. Our focus is on developing a program responsible for transferring tokens between different accounts through CPI.

By the end of this tutorial, you will gain insights into the concept of composability in Solana programming. We will discuss the process of transferring tokens between accounts.
