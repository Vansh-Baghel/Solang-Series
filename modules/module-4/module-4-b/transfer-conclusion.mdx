modulePartDescription: In this part of the module, we will enhance our previous token minter program by enabling the transfer of minted tokens to another account through cross-program invocation. Subsequently, we will proceed to build, deploy, and test the program.

## Conclusion

To wrap up our module on How to Transfer Solana Tokens with Solidity, we've expanded on our previous discussion of cross-program invocation. This time, we've dived into the details of Solana token transfers and explained how Associated Token Accounts play a crucial role in making these transfers happen on the Solana network.

We put this knowledge into action by performing a transfer using the CPI method for the Gold Tokens that we minted in our SPL Token program.

In the next module we will learn about Program Derived Addresses.
