modulePartDescription: In this part of the module, we will enhance our previous token minter program by enabling the transfer of minted tokens to another account through cross-program invocation. Subsequently, we will proceed to build, deploy, and test the program.

## Objectives

In this lesson, you will:

- Build your upgraded spl-token-minter program.
- Deploy and test your upgraded program.

## tl;dr

In this lesson, you go through the process of building the upgraded spl-token-minter program. Once the program has been built successfully, the process of connecting your wallet to your devnet and airdropping testnet tokens is explained. 

After building, we start up a new Solana devnet cluster and deploy our upgraded spl-token-minter program to the devnet. After deployment, we run tests for our deployed program

## Overview

## Building

To start off, open the terminal in the root directory of your project and enter the following command.

```bash
anchor build
```

This command will generate a target folder in the project root and generate idl and types of our solana program to interact with the client side using rpc methods. Now, open a new terminal and check our configuration by executing this command:


## Deploying

```bash
solana config get
```

After execution, you should get an output similar as shown below:

```bash
Config File: ~/.config/solana/cli/config.yml
RPC URL: https://api.devnet.solana.com
WebSocket URL: wss://api.devnet.solana.com/ (computed)
Keypair Path: ~/.config/solana/id.json
Commitment: confirmed
```

Devnet is the RPC URL, and my wallet's default location is at keypairpath. Make sure you Generate a wallet keypair for deploying the program. You can set devnet for cluster by entering this command:

```bash
solana config set --url https://api.devnet.solana.com
```

Enter this command to generate a new keypair

```bash
solana-keygen new
```

Now you have a wallet. You can check the address (pubkey) and balance of this account entering these commands

```bash
solana address
solana balance
```

If you have some devnet sol then it is okay for deployment. If not, then get some devnet airdrop in your wallet by entering this command:

```bash
solana airdrop 4
```

Up next, start off deployment by opening a new terminal and starting network cluster by executing this command:

```bash
solana-test-validator
```

This will start a devnet cluster in the system. To deploy the program, enter the following command:

```bash
anchor deploy
```

You should get an output similar to as shown below:

```bash
Deploying cluster: https://api.devnet.solana.com
Upgrade authority: ~/.config/solana/id.json
Deploying program "spl_token_minter"...
Program path: /Users/shivamsoni/Desktop/composability/transfergold/transfergold/target/deploy/spl_token_minter.so...
Program Id: EhJE9AUd8ybeRoTz79QHrxG6j3Z2hWX22g4SCSCKmGwE

Deploy success
```

Now our both program is on chain (devnet). Next, we get the program id of our deployed program on the chain. For this, grab this program id and change it in our program (solidity file) as well as anchor.toml file. After pasting the new program id to both files, build the program again with the command:

```bash
anchor build
```

Next, to test the program, we first check the required dependencies and run the following command:

```bash
yarn install
npm install
```

## Testing

Now, run tests by entering this command:

```bash
anchor test
```

After this, you should get an output as shown below:

```bash

And that's it! We've successfully made a CPI call to transfer gold token from our account to the recipient’s account.
