# Objective

In this lession, you will be able to:

- Introduce Solana to Ethereum developers.
- Highlight Solanaâ€™s advantages over Ethereum.

## tl;dr

This lession introduces solana, which is for Ethereum developers to get started with Solana. The next lession explores why Solana is a preferred choice for building blockchain applications.

# Overview

Solana is a fast and efficient blockchain platform designed for decentralized applications (dApps) and cryptocurrencies. By blending advanced technologies, Solana achieves impressive scalability and fast transaction processing.

Recognized as one of the most cost-effective and rapid public blockchains worldwide, Solana's speed and economic efficiency set it apart.

Unlike Ethereum's single-threaded execution and EOS's WASM-based runtimes, Solana introduces a groundbreaking approach called Sealevel. This innovative smart contracts runtime operates , handling thousands of contracts at once. It optimizes the Validator's infrastructure to enhance Solana's exceptional performance.

In the next lession, we will take a look at the Solana blockchain, and why building on Solana might be preferred over other blockchains.
