# Introduction to Solana

# Objective

In this lesson, you will be able to:

- Introduce Solana to Ethereum developers.
- Highlight Solanaâ€™s advantages over Ethereum.
- Briefly goes through Module 1.

## tl;dr

This module introduces Module 1, which is for Ethereum developers to get started with Solana and provides a practical example for making tokens using Solidity on Solana. The next lesson explores why Solana is a preferred choice for building blockchain applications.

# Overview

Solana is a fast and efficient blockchain platform designed for decentralized applications (dApps) and cryptocurrencies. By blending advanced technologies, Solana achieves impressive scalability and fast transaction processing.

Recognized as one of the most cost-effective and rapid public blockchains worldwide, Solana's speed and economic efficiency set it apart.

Unlike Ethereum's single-threaded execution and EOS's WASM-based runtimes, Solana introduces a groundbreaking approach called Sealevel. This innovative smart contracts runtime operates , handling thousands of contracts at once. It optimizes the Validator's infrastructure to enhance Solana's exceptional performance.

## About the Module

The first module has two parts:

1. **Basics for EVM Developers**: This part is for developers who know Ethereum and want to learn about Solana. It gives you a good start for the series.
2. **Practical Example**: spl-token-minter: The second part has a hands-on example using a Solidity program called spl-token-minter with the Anchor framework. It teaches you how to make tokens on Solana using Solidity

In the next lesson, we will take a look at the Solana blockchain, and why building on Solana might be preferred over other blockchains.
