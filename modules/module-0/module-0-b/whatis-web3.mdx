# What is Web3

# Introduction to Web3

Web3 essentially represents a paradigm shift in the way we interact with and experience the internet. Web3 is designed to empower individuals with greater control over their online identity, data, and digital assets. It achieves this by utilizing blockchain technology. 
The heart of web3 is blockchain technology. Blockchain technology plays a critical role in the development of Web3, as it provides a strong foundation for decentralization, security, and trust - three essential pillars of this new internet era. 
With decentralization at its core, Web3 will bring security, transparency, and better regulation compliance to the enterprises and creators. By giving users full control over their data, assets, and interactions, web3 is driving a paradigm shift towards greater online autonomy and transparency. Hence, its revolutionary potential to transform the way we interact online cannot be overstated.

# The Evolution of the Web

## Web 1.0 and Web 2.0

Web 1.0 and Web 2.0 are the two earliest versions of the Internet. 
Web 1.0 was a read-only version, also known as the syntactic web. It was developed by Tim Berners Lee and it consisted of a few people creating static web pages that were read by a large group of users. Web 1.0 was almost all static websites, and there was close to no interaction between users, leading to it being known as the read-only web.
Later, Web 2.0 emerged, which is the version we currently use. The Web 2.0 period began in 2004 with the emergence of social media platforms. Web 2.0 is characterized by interactivity, ease of use, and compatibility between systems and devices. However, the current system is dominated by large internet firms such as Google, Facebook, and many others which limits individuals' empowerment, as the individualsâ€™ data is with all these large firms.

## Web 3.0 or web3

Finally Web 3.0 came in prominence in around 2014 shortly after the launch of Ethereum. 
It is known as the read-write-execute version of the Internet. The main aim of Web 3.0 is to provide excellent user utility along with anonymity. With Web 3.0, users can expect a more dynamic and interactive experience where they have greater control over their online identity and privacy. Simply put, web3 is the internet owned by the builders and users themselves.

# Characteristics of web3

web3 is:

- **Verifiable**: Information and transactions are transparent and can be easily checked.
- **Trustless**: Users can interact without relying on intermediaries or trust in third parties.
- **Self-governing**: Decisions and rules are made by the community and enforced in code, not central authorities.
- **Permissionless**: No one needs permission to participate in the network or use its services.
- **Distributed and robust**: Data is spread across many computers, making the system resilient.
- **Stateful**: History of actions is always recorded, which is crucial for complex applications.
- **Native Built-in Payments**: It supports cryptocurrency transactions directly within the platform.

# Limitations of web3

As with every other technology that exists, few limitations also exist for web3. Some of them are listed below:

- **Poor User Experience**: Compared to Web2 products, which have been fine-tuned over two decades of development, Web3 has relatively poor user experience standards. Additionally, the utility of Web3 products, such as NFTs, remains unclear to many consumers and enterprises, which could be a hurdle to their adoption.
- **Consumer Protection**: As several Web3 projects have failed recently, consumer and investor protection is becoming increasingly important, and regulators and the general public are focusing on it.
- **Awareness**: Ensuring public awareness of Web 3.0 can only be done by educating them. Similar to Web 1.0 and Web 2.0, it is essential to make sure that awareness reaches the audience that we are in a new generation of the Internet.

# Conclusion

The transition from the read-only Web 1.0 to the interactive Web 2.0, which was dominated by the leading tech giants, has led to the emergence of Web3 - an internet that is owned and controlled by the people. Web 3's verifiable, trustless, and self-governing nature, along with the ability to facilitate native payments and robustness, marks the beginning of a new digital era. Web3 is going to introduce several new technologies including intelligent systems, decentralization, metaverse, digital assets, and more. As Web3 continues to develop, it is imperative to delve deeper into this transformative landscape and become a part of its evolution, as it promises to redefine how we experience the digital world.
