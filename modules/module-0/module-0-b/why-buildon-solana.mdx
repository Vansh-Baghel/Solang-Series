# Why Build on Solana

# Objective

In this lesson, you will understand why a blockchain developer would prefer Solana for development, including:

- Diverse smart contract options
- Scalability and Performance
- Community and Scope for Growth

## tl;dr

This lesson goes through the reasons why one should consider building on Solana. Smart contracts in Solana support multiple programming languages, including Rust, C, C++, Python, and Solidity. Solana has a massive community with low transaction costs, and it's significantly faster than Ethereum. You'll find plenty of tools to help you on your Solana development journey, and the next lesson covers Solidity for Ethereum and Solana-compatible dApps.

## Overview

### Starting in the Solana Ecosystem

If you're new to Solana, don't worry – you do not need an extensive background in smart contracts or blockchain to start building.

In Solana, smart contracts are like programs you can call, and you can use different programming languages to create them. You'll find Rust (native and through Anchor), C, C++, Python (using Seahorse), and even the new addition of Solidity (with Solang and Anchor) for building and deploying these programs on the chain.

By participating, you gain access to a sprawling community of millions, till August 2023 Solana encompassing over 11 million active accounts. This environment has facilitated the minting of more than 21 million NFTs, **all at an average transaction cost of $0.00025**. , Solana currently boasts a transaction throughput of 4,386 transactions per second (tps), in stark contrast to Ethereum's 24.02 tps.

As you delve into Solana's development realm, you'll find an array of tools and technologies ready to assist you, ensuring a seamless journey into the world of Solana building. 

## The Ecosystem

The Solana ecosystem is an innovative force in the blockchain and cryptocurrency space. Its core is the Solana blockchain, renowned for its lightning-fast transaction processing and low fees, making it a prime choice for decentralised applications (dApps) and DeFi platforms. Solana's unique consensus mechanism, Proof of History, enhances scalability and facilitates thousands of transactions per second.

The technological prowess has attracted diverse projects and developers to the ecosystem. DeFi protocols like Step Finance and Orca offer efficient trading and yield farming, while NFT marketplaces like Drip and Solsea showcase the ecosystem's adaptability. The Solana Foundation has fostered growth through grants and support, encouraging the development of an extensive network of infrastructure. As the Solana ecosystem continues to expand, it showcases the potential of blockchain technology, offering speed, scalability, and a vibrant community for the future of decentralised applications and financial systems.

## The Thriving Community of Millions

The Solana community is an incredibly diverse and passionate group of individuals, including developers, enthusiasts, and investors. Their support for the Solana blockchain has been instrumental in its rapid rise. The community is known for its strong commitment to promoting innovation and driving progress within the Solana ecosystem. Their hard work and dedication towards the ecosystem continue to contribute to the success of the Solana network.
