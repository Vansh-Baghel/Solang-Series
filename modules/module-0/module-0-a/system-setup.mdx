## **Objective**

*By the end of this lession, you'll be able to:*

- set up your system for start Solana development using Solidity.
- install required tools and tech stack for this course and every example we build along course.

## tl;dr

This quickstart guide will demonstrate how to install and setup your local development environment, getting you ready to start developing and deploying Solana solidity programs to the blockchain.

## Overview

In this lession, you will learn to install and setup the system for local solana development (Backend + CLI + Client), Rust, Anchor, Solana tools and JavaScript installation:
This setup is written for macOs and linux for windows you can look here [Solana_window_setup](https://github.com/buildspace/buildspace-projects/blob/main/Solana_And_Web3/en/Section_2/Resources/windows_setup.md).

- The System Pre-requesties
- Checkpoint One
- Install The Solana CLI
- Install Anchor Framework
- Checkpoint Two
- Create FileSystem Wallet.
- Airdrop Devnet SOL tokens
- Install and Configure Solang
- Install Solang VSCode Extension
- Setup a localhost blockchain cluster
- Client side setup


## The System Pre-Requisites

1. **Node.js** - It is recommended to install Node 

   - [Install Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en)


2. **Install Rust** - Rust will be using for setup solang, uses compile solidity into solana byte code format 

   - [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)


```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

3. **Install yarn**

   - [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)

```bash
npm i -g yarn
```

## Checkpoint One

**Confirm installation by running these commands**

```bash
rustc --version
node --version
yarn --version
cargo --version
```

you get something look like this 

```bash
rustc 1.70.0
v17.8.0
1.22.19
cargo 1.70.0
```


## Install the Solana CLI

- #### [CLI](https://solanacookbook.com/getting-started/installation.html#install-cli)

- #### [OS BASED](https://solanacookbook.com/getting-started/installation.html#macos-linux)

Open your Terminal. Replace `LATEST_RELEASE` with your desired version and install the **[latest Solana release](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/releases)** on your machine by running:

```bash
sh -c "$(curl -sSfL https://release.solana.com/LATEST_RELEASE/install)"
```

You can replace `LATEST_RELEASE` with the release tag matching the software version of your desired release, or use one of the three symbolic channel names: `stable`, `beta`, or `edge`. To find the latest release, check versions available **[here](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/releases)**.

The following output indicates a successful update:

```
downloading LATEST_RELEASE installer
Configuration: /home/solana/.config/solana/install/config.yml
Active release directory: /home/solana/.local/share/solana/install/active_release
* Release version: LATEST_RELEASE
* Release URL: https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/releases/download/LATEST_RELEASE/solana-release-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.bz2
Update successful
```

Depending on your system, the end of the installer messaging may prompt you to

```bash
Please update your PATH environment variable to include the solana programs:
```

If you get the above message, copy and paste the recommended command below it to update `PATH`.

Confirm you have the desired version of `solana` installed by running:

```bash
solana --version
```

## Install Anchor Framework

 **Anchor - Installing using Anchor version manager avm recommended**

-  [Install Anchor](https://www.anchor-lang.com/docs/installation)

## Checkpoint Two

Check what we get after running these command in terminal

```bash
solana --version
anchor --version
```

you get something look like this 

```bash
solana-cli 1.17.3
anchor-cli 0.29.0
```

## Create FileSystem Wallet

- [Create Wallet](https://docs.solana.com/getstarted/local#create-a-file-system-wallet)

To deploy a program with Solana CLI, you will need a Solana wallet with SOL tokens to pay for the cost of transactions.

Let's create a simple file system wallet for testing:

```bash
solana-keygen new
```

By default, the `solana-keygen` command will create a new file system wallet located at `~/.config/solana/id.json`. You can manually specify the output file location using the `--outfile /path` option.

> NOTE: If you already have a file system wallet saved at the default location, this command will NOT override it (unless you explicitly force override using the --force flag).
> 

### Set your new wallet as default

- [Set default wallet](https://docs.solana.com/getstarted/local#set-your-new-wallet-as-default)

With your new file system wallet created, you must tell the Solana CLI to use this wallet to deploy and take ownership of your on chain program:

```bash
solana config set -k ~/.config/solana/id.json
```

## Airdrop Devnet SOL tokens

- [Airdrop devnet tokens for deployment](https://docs.solana.com/getstarted/local#airdrop-sol-tokens-to-your-wallet)

Once your new wallet is set as the default, you can request a free airdrop of SOL tokens to it:

```bash
solana airdrop 2
```

> NOTE: The solana airdrop command has a limit of how many SOL tokens can be requested per airdrop for each cluster (localhost, testnet, or devent). If your airdrop transaction fails, lower your airdrop request quantity and try again.
> 

You can check your current wallet's SOL balance any time:

```
solana balance
```

## Install and Configure Solang

The newest Solang version comes already included with the Solana Tools Suite that you've set up before. It should now work well together with Solana CLI.

To make sure Solang is installed correctly, use this command.

```
Solang --version
```

If everything is fine you see something like this:

```
➜  ~ solang --version
solang version v0.3.3
```

## Install Solang VSCode Extension

![extension](/moduleimages/ext.png)

## Setup a localhost blockchain cluster

- [setup cluster](https://docs.solana.com/getstarted/local#setup-a-localhost-blockchain-cluster)

The Solana CLI comes with the [test validator](https://docs.solana.com/developing/test-validator) built in. This command line tool will allow you to run a full blockchain cluster on your machine.

```bash
solana-test-validator
```

> PRO TIP: Run the Solana test validator in a new/separate terminal window that will remain open. The command line program must remain running for your localhost cluster to remain online and ready for action.

Configure your Solana CLI to use your localhost validator for all your future terminal commands:

```bash
solana config set --url localhost
```

At any time, you can view your current Solana CLI configuration settings:

```bash
solana config get
```

## Client side setup

#### **Install Web3.js**

There are a few libraries that you can use to get started with JavaScript or TypeScript on Solana.

- [Web3.js](https://solanacookbook.com/getting-started/installation.html#web3-js)

**`[@solana/web3.js](https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/)`** is a library that has the basic Solana tools to interact, send transactions, and read from the blockchain.

You can install with the following:

- **YARN**
- **NPM**
- **BROWSER**

```bash
yarn add @solana/web3.js
```

 - [SPL-Token](https://solanacookbook.com/getting-started/installation.html#spl-token)

`@solana/spl-token` is a library that contains many of the JavaScript/TypeScript bindings needed to interact with SPL tokens. You can use this library to mint new SPL tokens, transfer tokens, and more.

You can install this library with the following:

- **YARN**
- **NPM**
- **BROWSER**

```bash
yarn add @solana/spl-token
```

- [Wallet-Adapter](https://solanacookbook.com/getting-started/installation.html#wallet-adapter)

There is a collection of libraries that can help bootstrap wallet connections within Solana called wallet-adapter. Currently the package supports use within Svelte, Angular, Vue, and React. Wallet-adapter can quickstart your dApp integration with wallets like **[Phantomopen,](https://phantom.app/) [Solflareopen](https://solflare.com/) and more**.

You can install this library with the following:

- **YARN**
- **NPM**

```bash
yarn add @solana/wallet-adapter-wallets \@solana/wallet-adapter-base
```
